                <p> Sports Tourism is defined as a specific travel outside of the usual environment for either passive or active involvement in competitive sport and international sports tournament where sport is the prime motivational reason for travel and the touristic or leisure element may act to reinforce the overall experience. Another definition worth noting explains sport tourism as a combination of sports activities and travel.  </p>
                <br>
                <p>From a sport marketing and sport management perspective, it consists of two broad categories of products: a: sports participation travel (travel for the purpose of participating in a sports, recreation, leisure or fitness activity); and b) sports spectatorial travel (travel for the purpose of spectating sports, recreation, leisure or fitness activities or events considering the international sports coverage of the event for sports magazine.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Nowadays, many countries are organising mega sports events to improve its economic growth. Some people favours the concept of hosting international sports event by a country, whereas, others believe it is just a waste of time and money. There are valid opinions to weigh both the sides of the discussion, which I will consider in the following paragraphs.
<br><br>
On one hand, it helps in providing an astounding improvement in the infrastructure of the city where the event is being organised. It also builds reputation and dignity of the host country all over the world. Then, it encourages tourism and creates bright avenues of employment. Moreover, the host country also earns very high revenue by selling tickets of the event. Eventually, arranging international sports events boost the economy of the host country.</p>

It is an event organized in the holidays and aimed at teaching various new skills to students in order to promote a learning environment and to equip them with real world skills, apart from the set academic learning. The progress of a student in these camps on various activities is closely monitored by counsellors and expert teachers present there. There are various kinds of summer camps.
